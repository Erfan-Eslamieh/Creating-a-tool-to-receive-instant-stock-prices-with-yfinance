# 📈 Stock Price Tool with LangChain & yfinance

## 📖 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to create a **custom tool for retrieving real-time stock prices** using the LangChain framework integrated with yfinance. The project showcases how to build an **AI agent** that can fetch current stock prices and provide intelligent responses about financial data.

The project highlights:
- Creating custom tools with LangChain
- Integration with yfinance for real-time stock data
- Building AI agents with tool-calling capabilities
- Implementing Zero-Shot ReAct agents for financial queries

---

## 🧠 **Features**
- Real-time stock price retrieval using yfinance
- Custom LangChain tool creation
- AI agent with reasoning capabilities
- Support for any stock ticker symbol
- Verbose logging to understand agent decision-making
- Integration with OpenAI GPT models

---

## 📁 **File Structure**
- `Tools.ipynb` → Main notebook including:
  - Library installation and setup
  - Custom stock price function implementation
  - LangChain tool conversion
  - AI agent creation and configuration
  - Testing with real stock queries (AAPL, GOOGL)

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-tool.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd stock-price-tool
```

### 3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install yfinance langchain langchain-openai
```

### 4. Set up OpenAI API Key:
- Get your API key from OpenAI
- Add it to your Google Colab secrets or environment variables
- The notebook uses `userdata.get('Openai_api_key')` for secure access

### 5. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Tools.ipynb
```

## 📚 **Workflow Overview**

### ✅ **Step 1: Library Installation**
- Install yfinance for stock data retrieval
- Install langchain and langchain-openai for AI agent functionality

### ✅ **Step 2: Function Creation**
```python
def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> str:
    data = yf.Ticker(ticker).history(period="1d")
    price = data["Close"].iloc[-1]
    return f"The current price of {ticker.upper()} is ${price:.2f}"
```

### ✅ **Step 3: Tool Conversion**
- Convert Python function to LangChain Tool
- Define tool name, function, and description
- Create tools list for agent initialization

### ✅ **Step 4: Agent Creation**
- Initialize ChatOpenAI LLM with GPT-4o-mini
- Create Zero-Shot ReAct agent with verbose logging
- Configure agent with custom tools

### ✅ **Step 5: Testing & Usage**
- Test agent with real stock queries
- Observe reasoning process through verbose output
- Get accurate, real-time stock price information

## 🔧 **Code Structure**

### **Core Function:**
```python
import yfinance as yf
from langchain.tools import Tool

def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> str:
    data = yf.Ticker(ticker).history(period="1d")
    price = data["Close"].iloc[-1]
    return f"The current price of {ticker.upper()} is ${price:.2f}"
```

### **Tool Definition:**
```python
get_stock_price_tool = Tool(
    name="get_stock_price",
    func=get_stock_price,
    description="Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL)."
)
```

### **Agent Setup:**
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```

---

## 📊 **Example Usage**

### Query Example:
```python
response = agent.run("What is the current price of AAPL stock?")
```

### Expected Output:
```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I need to find the current stock price for AAPL. 
Action: get_stock_price
Action Input: "AAPL"
Observation: The current price of AAPL is $226.01
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The current price of AAPL stock is $226.01.
> Finished chain.
```
